Function 1:
Write a function which will take three string arguments.   The purpose of the function is to return to the caller the largest of the three strings.  

#Function One

def functionOne(stringOne,stringTwo,stringThree):
  lengthStringOne = len(stringOne)
  lengthStringTwo = len(stringTwo)
  lengthStringThree = len(stringThree)
  if(lengthStringOne > lengthStringTwo and lengthStringOne >lengthStringThree):
    return stringOne
  if (lengthStringTwo >lengthStringOne and lengthStringTwo > lengthStringThree):
    return stringTwo
  if (lengthStringThree > lengthStringOne and lengthStringThree > lengthStringTwo):
    return stringThree
  else:
    return "there is no one string that is largest"
#-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Test script 1
Write a script which will ask the user for three strings to test function 1. Confirm that none of the strings provided are of equal length.  If they are, ask the user for three more strings, keep asking until the user provides three strings of different lengths.  Once three strings of different lengths are provided display the longest string. 


#Test Script one
print("please enter a string")
userStringOne = input()
print("please enter a second string")
userStringTwo = input()
print("please enter a third string")
userStringThree = input()
lengthUserStringOne = len(userStringOne)
lengthUserStringTwo = len(userStringTwo)
lengthUserStringThree = len(userStringThree)
if (lengthUserStringOne == lengthUserStringTwo or lengthUserStringOne == lengthUserStringThree or lengthUserStringTwo == lengthUserStringThree):
    flag = True
    while(flag):
      print("please enter a string")
      userStringOne = input()
      print("please enter a second string")
      userStringTwo = input()
      print("please enter a third string")
      userStringThree = input()
      lengthUserStringOne = len(userStringOne)
      lengthUserStringTwo = len(userStringTwo)
      lengthUserStringThree = len(userStringThree) 
      if (lengthUserStringOne == lengthUserStringTwo or lengthUserStringOne == lengthUserStringThree or lengthUserStringTwo == lengthUserStringThree):
        flag = True
      else:
        flag = False
print("The longest of the three strings are: " +  functionOne(userStringOne,userStringTwo,userStringThree))
      
#--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Function 2:
Write a function that takes two arguments of type int.  The purpose of the function is to generate 25 pairs of random numbers.  The first random number is between 0 and twice the value of int one, and the second random number is from 0 and twice the value of int two.  (For example if the arguments passed in are 3 and 4, the two random numbers will be between 0 and 6 and 0 and 8 respectively.)  Print each pair on the screen.  Once all the pairs are printed the function will return the total number of times that a random number was equal to its corresponding argument. For example if the arguments were 3 and 4 and the pairs were 5,7   1, 2    3,5   2,4 …  the count returned would be 2. 


#Function Two

import random
def functionTwo(intOne,intTwo):
  count = 0
  for i in range (25):
    firstRandomNumber = random.randint(0,(intOne*2))  
    secondRandomNumber = random.randint(0,(intTwo*2)) 
    print(firstRandomNumber, end = " ")
    print(secondRandomNumber)
    if (firstRandomNumber==intOne):
      count = count + 1
    if (secondRandomNumber == intTwo):
      count = count +1
  return count

#-------------------------------------------------
Test script 2
Write a script which will ask the user for two appropriate arguments to test function two. Call function two, if the number of times that a random number was equal to its corresponding argument was 2, print “Two matches – you win $100!!!”.


#Test script 2
print("please provide an integer")
userIntOne = int(input())
print("please provide a second integer")
userIntTwo = int(input())
returnValue = functionTwo(userIntOne,userIntTwo)
if (returnValue == 2):
  print("Two matches - you win $100")      
      
#---------------------------------------------
Function 3:
Write a third function that takes and int and a string argument.  The purpose of the function is to display a count backwards from the number of characters in the string up to and including the int.  For example if the arguments were 3, “ABCDEFGH” the count would be:
8,7,6,5,4,3


#Function Three

def functionThree(intOne,stringOne):
  lengthStringOne = len(stringOne)
  for i in range(lengthStringOne,intOne-1,-1):
    print(i)
#--------------------------------------------
Test script 3
Write a script which will ask the user for one int and one string argument and test function three.  


#Test Script3

print("Please enter an int")
userInt = int(input())
print("please enter a string")
userString = input()
print("here is your count that starts at a # equal to the length of your string and ends at the number you entered")
functionThree(userInt,userString)  
#----------------------------------------------------------
Test script 4
We know from physics that  time= distance/speed. Ask the user for the distance they traveled in kilometers and the speed they were travelling.  Use a try block to attempt to calculate the user’s time.  If the speed provided by the user was zero print ”error” and end the script, If they provide a valid number calculate their time and display the answer 100 times, once on each line.  


#test script 4

import sys
print("Please enter the distance you traveled in KM")
distance = int(input())
print("Please enter the speed you were travelling")
speed = int(input())
try:
  time = distance/speed
  for i in range (100):
    print("The time it took you to travel was: " + str(time) + " hours")
except ZeroDivisionError:
  print("ERROR")
  sys.exit()
