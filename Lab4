Challenge 1
Step 1	Generate a random from 10 to 50 inclusive.
Step 2	Ask the user to guess a number between 10 and 50
Step 3	If the user guessed the correct number display “You win”.
Step 4	If the user guessed a number that was too high display “too high, sorry”.
Step 5	If the user guessed a number that was too low display “too low, sorry”.

Challenge 2
Step 1	Modify the above script such that the user gets 3 guesses to guess the number, after three guesses the script will exit.

Challenge 3
Step 1	Modify the above script such that the user must provide a number which is inside the appropriate range.  If the provide a number outside the range they will be continually asked for a number until they provide one which is inside the appropriate range.
Step 2	Modify the above script such that when the user guesses the correct number that the words “you win” are displayed 7 times every second (without using the sleep function).
Step 3	Modify the above script such that when the user guesses the correct number that a count will be displayed from 10 to 50 but the number they guessed will be eliminated from the count (that is not displayed).
