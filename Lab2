Challenge #1

Step 1	Open the Python IDLE environment and editor. Write a script that accomplishes the following tasks listed below.
Step 2	Ask the user for their first name, and then store this information.
Step 3	Ask the user for a number between 1 and 100, and then store this information.
Step 4	If the number they provided was less than 50, print the number multiplied by 2 with an appropriate message.
Step 5	If the number they provided was equal to fifty, print the personâ€™s name replicated 7 times.
Step 6	If the number they provided was greater than 50, print the number squared with an appropriate message.
Step 7	Print out the number they entered, replicated 5 times.

print("what is your first name")
firstName=input()
print("choose any number between 1 to 100")
anyNumber=int(input())
if anyNumber<50:
    print(anyNumber*2)
elif anyNumber==50:
    print(firstName*7)
elif anyNumber>50:
    print(anyNumber*anyNumber)
print(str(anyNumber)*5)  

Challenge #2

Step 1	Write a script that asks the user for any positive number.
Step 2	If the number they provided was even ask the user for another number, keep asking until the user provides an odd number.
Step 3	Ask the user for another number between 5 and 25 inclusive.  If they provide a number outside this range keep asking until they provide a number within this range.
Step 4	Concatenate the two numbers and print the number of characters in the concatenated string divided by 3 using floor division.


print("choose any positive number")
positiveNumber=int(input())
while positiveNumber%2==0:
    print("please type any positive number")
    positiveNumber=int(input())
print("choose any number between 5 and 25")
anotherNumber=int(input())
while anotherNumber<5 or anotherNumber>25:
    print("choose another number between 5 and 25")
    anotherNumber=int(input())
concatinate=str(positiveNumber)+str(anotherNumber)
print(concatinate)
print(len(concatinate)//3)

Challenge #3

Step 1	Ask the user to pick one of four doors (i.e. door1,door2,door3,door4)
Step 2	If they choose door1 tell them they have won $10.
Step 3	If they choose door2 tell them they have won $20.
Step 4	If they choose door3 tell them they have won $0.
Step 5	If they choose door4 tell them they have won $100.
Step 6	If they type anything other than a valid response tell them they owe $100.


print("choose any of the four doors")
chosenDoor=int(input())
if chosenDoor==1:
    print('you won $10')
elif chosenDoor==2:
    print('you won $20')
elif chosenDoor==3:
    print('you won nothing')
elif chosenDoor==4:
    print('you won $100')
else:
    print('you owe $100')
