/#---Challenge #1

Step 1	Open the Python IDLE environment and editor. Write a script that accomplishes the following tasks listed below.
Step 2	Ask the user for their first name, and then store this information.
Step 3	Ask the user for a number between 1 and 100, and then store this information.
Step 4	If the number they provided was less than 50, print the number multiplied by 2 with an appropriate message.
Step 5	If the number they provided was equal to fifty, print the personâ€™s name replicated 7 times.
Step 6	If the number they provided was greater than 50, print the number squared with an appropriate message.
Step 7	Print out the number they entered, replicated 5 times. ---/#

#Display user's first name
print("what is your first name")
#Storing the first name
firstName=input()
#Displaying any number between 1 and 100
print("type any number between 1 and 100")
#Storing any number in integer
anyNumber=int(input())
#Using if statement for any number less than 50
if anyNumber<50:
    #Printing any number multiplied by 2    
    print(anyNumber*2)
#Using elif statement for any number is equal to 50    
elif anyNumber==50:
    #Printing first name 7 times    
    print(firstName*7)
#Using elif for condition any number is greater than 50    
elif anyNumber>50:
    #Printing the squared of any number    
    print(anyNumber*anyNumber)
#Replicating the any number number 5 times     
print(str(anyNumber)*5)

Challenge #2

Step 1	Write a script that asks the user for any positive number.
Step 2	If the number they provided was even ask the user for another number, keep asking until the user provides an odd number.
Step 3	Ask the user for another number between 5 and 25 inclusive.  If they provide a number outside this range keep asking until they provide a number within this range.
Step 4	Concatenate the two numbers and print the number of characters in the concatenated string divided by 3 using floor division.

#Asking for positive number
print("type any positive number")
#input positive number
positiveNumber=int(input())
#Using while statement for finding even or odd number
while positiveNumber%2==0:
    #Asking for positive number again    
    print("please type positive number")
    #input positive number    
    positiveNumber=int(input())
#Asking another number between 5 and 25     
print("type another number between 5 and 25")
#input another number
anotherNumber=int(input())
#Using while for the entered number is out of the given range
while anotherNumber<5 or anotherNumber>25:
    #Asking again for another number    
    print("please type another number")
    #input another number    
    anotherNumber=int(input())
#concatination
concatination=str(positiveNumber)+str(anotherNumber)
#Printing concatenation
print(concatination)
#Printing length of concatination then do floor division of concatination length
print(len(concatination)//3)

Challenge #3

Step 1	Ask the user to pick one of four doors (i.e. door1,door2,door3,door4)
Step 2	If they choose door1 tell them they have won $10.
Step 3	If they choose door2 tell them they have won $20.
Step 4	If they choose door3 tell them they have won $0.
Step 5	If they choose door4 tell them they have won $100.
Step 6	If they type anything other than a valid response tell them they owe $100.


#Ask any door from 1 to 4
print("pick any door from 1 to 4")
#input chosen door number
chosenDoor=int(input())
#Using if statement for choosing door1
if chosenDoor==1:
    #Printing the reward fro choosing door 1       
    print('you have won $10')
#Using elif statement for door 2    
elif chosenDoor==2:
    #Printing the reward for door 2    
    print('you have won $20')
#Using elif for door 3    
elif chosenDoor==3:
    #Printing reward for doo3    
    print('you have won nothing')
#Using elif for door 4    
elif chosenDoor==4:
    #Printing reward for door 4    
    print('you have won $100')
#Using else statement    
else:
    #Printing the reward for other doors out of the range 1 to 4    
    print('you owe $100')
